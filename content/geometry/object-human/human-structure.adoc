== Armature_<Name> 

This object or group represents the armature (skeleton) of the object and contains all bones. It is needed to ensure that the bone hierarchy can be exported and imported correctly.
Depending on the 3D software, the armature is a separate _object type_ (for example in Blender) or represented by a group (for example in Maya).
The postfix `_<Name>` is optional, but is recommended to use, if you prepare multiple human assets in one file of an 3D application to keep the names unique and within the naming convention.
