== Motivation

A _3D asset_ is a digital entity that includes a 3D geometric representation of an object (also known as _3D model_ or _3D data file_) along with its attributes and metadata. 
Common formats for storing the geometry and visual materials of _3D models_ include glTF, FBX, and USD.

However, these formats do not provide a standardized way to structure the geometry or provide extensive metadata storage and exchange capabilities. 
The {THIS_STANDARD} standard addresses these needs.

This chapter includes all geometry-related definitions of {THIS_STANDARD}, marked in red in <<fig-openmaterial-geometry-overview>>.

The {THIS_STANDARD} asset file contains essential information relevant to the display and interactivity attributes of the _3D model_ in various computer applications.
This includes metadata, _material_ mappings, and semantic information like coordinate system and pivot point descriptions.
The mapping of materials is stored in a separate material mapping file (.xomm), which is linked in the asset file.
This setup ensures that the _3D asset_ (or _3D data file_) can be consistently integrated into complex simulations or real-time environments with detailed _material_ and dynamic properties.

== Applications

To accurately replicate how sensors interact with objects in the real world, it is essential to model the behavior of sensors like cameras, radars, and lidars based on the _material_ and geometric properties of objects in a virtual environment. For this purpose, assets that conform to the {THIS_STANDARD} standards may be necessary in various scenarios, such as:

* *Accurate simulation of sensor perception*: _3D assets_ are essential to ensure that sensors interact realistically with their environment. This includes both the visual representation, such as how objects appear and are detected by the sensor, and the _material_ properties, like how objects reflect or absorb signals such as light or radar waves.
* *Dynamic and real-time environment simulation*: _3D assets_ with changing materials or dynamic properties, such as moving parts like wheels, are necessary to simulate environments where the interaction between sensors and objects is constantly evolving.
* *Semantic labeling for machine learning applications*: Assets with semantic information about sub-meshes, or labels for parts of objects, enable the system to understand and differentiate between different parts of an object, such as the wheels or windows of a car, aiding in accurate training.
* *Re-using _3D assets_*: Using the same asset file in different simulation tools is only possible if the structure of the assets is standardized.


== Role of 3D exchange formats

3D exchange formats like glTF, FBX, and USD are widely used across various industries for standardized _3D model_ representation.

In the context of {THIS_STANDARD}, these formats form the foundation for seamlessly integrating {THIS_STANDARD} into existing 3D modeling and simulation workflows. 
Users can continue using their familiar tools and processes to manage geometry, while {THIS_STANDARD} extends these formats by adding _material properties_, semantic information, and dynamic behaviors through additional files, such as asset files and _material_ mapping files.

== Interaction with other ASAM standards

The ASAM OpenX standards strive to provide comprehensive, realistic, and exchangeable simulation data for the development and testing of autonomous systems:

* ASAM OpenDRIVE standardizes the description of road networks, including geometric definitions of the road, but primarily focuses on the semantic description of the road. 
  The {THIS_STANDARD} object class "Environment" enhances this by allowing the definition of a comprehensive _3D environment_ that aligns with an ASAM OpenDRIVE map.
* ASAM OpenSCENARIO XML is a file format created to describe dynamic content in driving and traffic simulators, with a primary focus on complex maneuvers involving multiple entities like vehicles and pedestrians.
  {THIS_STANDARD} defines node structures and metadata for these object classes to seamlessly integrate ASAM OpenSCENARIO XML definitions with a _3D model_.
  The asset file (.xoma) of a static _3D environment_ shall be linked in ASAM OpenSCENARIO XML using the https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/generated/content/RoadNetwork.html[SceneGraphFile property].
  Asset files (.xoma) of individual objects, such as vehicles, shall be linked using the https://publications.pages.asam.net/standards/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_XML/latest/07_components_scenario/07_02_storyboard_entities.html[model3d property].
  Both environment and objects may either be given as an absolute path or as a path relative to the ASAM OpenSCENARIO XML file (.xosc).
  A relative path is indicated by a dot (.) as the first character.
  The paths to 3D assets specified in the _scenario_ definition shall serve as single source of truth and be used consistently in simulation environments.
  In the case of distributed simulation environments, the paths shall be synchronized between all relevant simulation components.
  Synchronization may be implemented using ASAM Open Simulation Interface (OSI).
* ASAM Open Simulation Interface is a specification for interfaces between models and components in a distributed simulation.
  ASAM OSI primarily focuses on the environmental perception of automated driving functions, but it also covers interfaces for models of traffic participants.
  The asset file (.xoma) of a _3D environment_ shall be linked in ASAM OSI using the https://opensimulationinterface.github.io/osi-antora-generator/asamosi/current/gen/structosi3_1_1GroundTruth.html#a83042861723a4a9e890a53aa98d88858[GroundTruth::model_reference].
  Asset files (.xoma) of individual objects, like vehicles, shall be linked with the https://opensimulationinterface.github.io/osi-antora-generator/asamosi/current/gen/structosi3_1_1MovingObject.html#a07558573bee7a5fa2f0729e1cad1325f[MovingObject::model_reference] or the https://opensimulationinterface.github.io/osi-antora-generator/asamosi/current/gen/structosi3_1_1StationaryObject.html#aad1c24fcdb11699954bf3494b8632288[StationaryObject::model_reference].
  Both environment and objects may either be given as an absolute path or a relative path.
  A relative path is indicated by a dot (.) as the first character.
  As ASAM OSI transfers the data between tools and simulation models, the root path that a relative model reference path is relative to, has to be given or known to all tools and models in the tool chain.
  This can be done with tool settings, configs, or model parameters, for example, an functional mock-up interface (FMI) parameter.

The transformation of reference frames between these ASAM standards is described in xref:../07_geometry/general.adoc#_local_coordinate_system[Local coordinate system].

Examples for all interactions are provided in the https://github.com/asam-ev/OpenMATERIAL-3D/tree/main/examples/scenario_example[scenario_example folder].
