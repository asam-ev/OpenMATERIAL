== Overview

=== Motivation

Accurate sensor simulation that replicates physical phenomena is essential for evaluating the safety of AD/ADAS in virtual environments. 

However, previous simulations were limited by computational power and memory, making them visually believable but not physically accurate. 
Consequently, these simulations were mainly used in the early development stages, where precise physical modeling was not necessary.

With increased computing power and improved simulation techniques, virtual testing now plays a crucial role at all stages of system development. 
This aligns with the growing need to accurately represent the real-world in simulations, known as digital twins, especially as the demand for physical sensor simulation rises. 
A fundamental step in virtually describing the real-world is providing a full physical description of all objects, including their _material properties_ and 3D geometries.

Standardizing the representation of data and attributes, such as scenarios, road data, and asset data, is extremely important for AD/ADAS simulation. This promotes data circulation and ensures consistent results across different systems. 

Standardization efforts have been made for scenarios and road data using ASAM OpenSCENARIO, ASAM OpenDRIVE, ASAM OpenCRG, and other standards. 
{THIS_STANDARD} advances standardization by providing standardized definitions of _material properties_ and 3D geometry.

=== The two main chapters of {THIS_STANDARD}

{THIS_STANDARD} is divided into distinct yet complementary chapters: https://asam-ev.github.io/OpenMATERIAL/asamopenmaterial/latest/specification/geometry/geometry-index.html[Geometry] and https://asam-ev.github.io/OpenMATERIAL/asamopenmaterial/latest/specification/material/material-index.html[Material].
Each chapter addresses specific aspects of the standard, enabling users to adopt and implement the parts most relevant to their needs.

* *Material*: This chapter includes definitions and file formats for storing and exchanging _material properties_. These properties can be physical, such as surface roughness, permittivity, and index of refraction, or measured data, like wavelength and angle-dependent reflectance values.
* *Geometry*: This chapter contains structures for different object classes. These structures define uniform node structure, naming scheme and coordinate systems to enable exchange, common integration and animation of _3D models_.

{THIS_STANDARD} supports a modular approach to compliance. Based on their individual use-cases, users of {THIS_STANDARD} can decide if they want to implement the standard for _3D models_, materials, or both:

* https://asam-ev.github.io/OpenMATERIAL/asamopenmaterial/latest/specification/geometry/geometry-index.html[*Geometry Chapter] Compliance*: Users who primarily deal with geometric data, such as _3D models_, shapes, or spatial structures, can claim compliance with the Geometry chapter independently.
* https://asam-ev.github.io/OpenMATERIAL/asamopenmaterial/latest/specification/material/material-index.html[*Material Chapter] Compliance*: Users who focus on _material properties_ can claim compliance with the material chapter alone.
* *Full Compliance*: For a full exchange and use of simulation-ready _3D assets_ however, both parts must be supported. Users who implement and support both _material_ and geometric data according to this standard can claim full compliance with {THIS_STANDARD}.

A list of use cases examples can be found in the https://asam-ev.github.io/OpenMATERIAL/asamopenmaterial/latest/specification/use-cases/use-cases.html[Use Cases] chapter, each highlighting its relevance to the material chapter, the geometry chapter, or both.

=== Structure and file formats

{THIS_STANDARD} defines various file formats for specifying assets, _material properties_, and the mapping between them.
<<fig-openmaterial-overview>> illustrates these file formats and their interconnections.
The definitions of the geometry related data formats marked in red can be found in xref:geometry/geometry-index.adoc[].
The definitions of the _material_ related data formats marked in blue can be found in xref:material/material-index.adoc[].

.Overview of {THIS_STANDARD} file formats and data flow
image::overview.png[,1100]

The first interaction with an {THIS_STANDARD}-compliant _3D model_ is through the asset file.

The *asset file* is a JSON file with the file extension .xoma ({THIS_STANDARD} Asset).
A detailed definition of the https://github.com/asam-ev/OpenMATERIAL/blob/main/schemas/asset_schema.json[asset file JSON schema] is given in xref:geometry/asset-schema.adoc[].
The asset file shall have the same name as a corresponding 3D data file in glTF, FBX or USD format.
To facilitate instancing, multiple asset file may be linked to a single _3D model_ file by adding an index separated by a dot (.) as a suffix to the asset file name.
It contains metadata, such as description, unique identifier, version information, copyright details, and so on.
It also includes a _material_ texture assignment table, allowing dedicated _material_ mapping textures to be assigned to materials within 3D data files.
This enables comprehensive _material properties_ to be mapped to the geometry at a texture level.
Each texel of the texture contains a 32 Bit code (8 Bit values in the rgba channels) which is mapped to a _material property_ file in a separate _material_ mapping file, linked in the asset file with a URI.
For the mapping currently only the rba channels are used (first 24 Bit).
The last channel is reserved for future use.
An https://github.com/asam-ev/OpenMATERIAL/tree/main/examples/example_asset.xoma[example asset] is provided in the examples folder of the repository.

The *3D data file* is a standard _3D model_ file in glTF, FBX or USD format.
Multiple formats can exist in parallel, so one asset file can have multiple 3D data files with different formats with the same name as the asset file.
However, to be standard compliant, a simulation environment must support at least one of the named 3D data formats.
More information about the file formats is given in is given in xref:geometry/file-format-support.adoc[].
An https://github.com/asam-ev/OpenMATERIAL/tree/main/examples/example_asset.gltf[example model] is provided in the examples folder of the repository.

The *material mapping file* is separated from the asset file to facilitate reusability.
Multiple assets can link to the same _material_ mapping, allowing simulation systems to have a unified mapping table for all assets. 
A detailed definition of the https://github.com/asam-ev/OpenMATERIAL/blob/main/schemas/mapping_schema.json[mapping file JSON schema] is given in xref:geometry/mapping-schema.adoc[].
It contains metadata, such as description, unique identifier, version information, and the _material_ mapping table.
Each row in this table maps a _material_ name or an RGB value to a _material property_ file and includes a human-readable description of the material.
This setup allows for two mapping possibilities:

* Mapping one _material property_ file per _material_ in the _3D model_.
* Mapping a texture code of an {THIS_STANDARD} assignment texture to a _material property_ file, enabling detailed differentiation between _material properties_.

An https://github.com/asam-ev/OpenMATERIAL/tree/main/examples/example_mapping.xomm[example mapping file] is provided in the examples folder of the repository.

The *material property file* contains metadata and the properties of one material.
Similar to the mapping file, _material property_ files can also be reused for different assets.
A detailed definition of the https://github.com/asam-ev/OpenMATERIAL/blob/main/schemas/material_schema.json[material file JSON schema] is given in xref:material/material-schema.adoc[].
Some material properties depend on other simulation quantities, such as wavelength of the simulated sensor, temperature, and humidity.
To avoid overloading one material file with large look-up tables, these are placed in auxiliary look-up table files linked with URIs in the main _material property_ file. 
The defined look-up tables include:

* xref:material/material-emp-schema.adoc[Electromagnetic properties]
* xref:material/material-optical-schema.adoc[Optical properties]
* xref:material/material-brdf-schema.adoc[Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs)]

Examples for _material property_ files and look-up table files are provided in the https://github.com/asam-ev/OpenMATERIAL/tree/main/examples/[examples folder] of the repository.
