== Motivation

In virtual environments and simulations, the accurate representation of materials plays a critical role in achieving realism and ensuring proper interaction between objects and perception sensors.
_Material properties_, such as roughness, permittivity, and index of refraction, influence how sensors like cameras, radars, and lidars perceive and interact with objects.
However, existing formats for materials in _3D models_ lack a standardized way to represent and manage multi-spectral materials, which can lead to inconsistencies in simulation scenarios and are not exchangeable between simulation tools.

The {THIS_STANDARD} standard addresses this gap by providing a robust framework for defining materials in a way that is comprehensive, multi-spectral, and interchangeable.

This chapter includes all _material_ definitions of {THIS_STANDARD}, marked in blue in <<fig-openmaterial-material-overview>>.

The first point of contact with a _material_ is the **Material Data File** (for example, `my-material.xomp`).
This file contains metadata as well as basic _material properties_, such as roughness or density.
The _material_ data file may link one or multiple wavelength-dependent **Look-up Table Files** (.xompt).
There are different kinds of look-up tables:

- Electromagnetic properties (`*_emp.xompt`) containing complex permeability and permittivity values
- Optical properties (`*_optical.xompt`) containing complex index of refraction values
- BRDFs (`*_brdf.xompt`) containing bidirectional reflectance distribution values
- Reflectance (`*_reflectance.xompt`) containing reflectance values

== Applications

{THIS_STANDARD} materials are useful in a variety of scenarios where _material properties_ are critical for realistic simulations and interactions.
Some key use cases include:

- Accurate simulation of sensor perception:
  To simulate sensors in virtual environments, the _material properties_ of objects must be accurately defined.
  These definitions require wavelength-dependent multi-spectral _material_ definitions, as various sensor types perceive the environment differently.

- _Material_ reusability across platforms:
  To ensure consistency in simulations, _3D assets_ including their _material_ data must be reusable across different tools and platforms.
  Therefore, _material_ definitions need to be compatible and portable, allowing the same _materials_ to be used in various simulation environments without requiring rework or translation.
