= General

A vehicle is any machine that moves on land and is either self-propelled or attached to a self-propelled machine.
Trailers or train wagons are considered separate vehicles.
However, permanently attached parts, such as the front and rear of an articulated bus, are considered parts of a single vehicle.
The vehicle class includes all land vehicles, whether wheeled or tracked.
In this version of the standard, only wheeled vehicles are considered.

The vehicle's 3D geometry is structured according to the node structure defined in xref:../geometry/object-vehicle/vehicle-index.adoc#_model_structure[Model structure].
The structure begins with a Root node, which is the parent of all other nodes. 
The origin of the Root node is the center of the vehicle's bounding box projected to the ground, including all vehicle parts in their default positions, meaning the vehicle is under neutral load conditions, the wheels are running straight, the doors are closed and the lights are off.
This origin can easily be transformed to coordinate frames from other ASAM standards, such as ASAM OpenSCNEARIO XML vehicle coordinates as well as ASAM OSI object coordinates and host vehicle coordinates,
see xref:../geometry/general.adoc#_local_coordinate_system[Geometry General section].

Separating vehicle elements into different groups allows for the movement or animation of parts, such as wheels and doors, positioning external light sources in a simulation, and many other use cases.
Group nodes are empty nodes representing the coordinate origin of the contained geometry.
Meshes should be placed in the corresponding group node.
Not all nodes need to be present in every vehicle _3D model_, as not all vehicles have parts that fit all groups.
Additional group nodes may be added to support additional use cases, but they shall be integrated into the general structure of external or internal and static or dynamic groups and follow the naming convention.

Groups with a local transform are indicated in the structure by a (T).
This is only an indicator in the documentation and must not be contained in the actual node name.
