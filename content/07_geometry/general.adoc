== Coordinate systems

{THIS_STANDARD} uses the following types of coordinate systems:

* World coordinate system, see <<World coordinate system>>
* Local coordinate system, see <<Local coordinate system>>

Both coordinate systems consist of three orthogonal directions associated with
x-, y-, and z-axes, and a coordinate origin where axes meet. The coordinate
systems are right-handed Cartesian coordinate systems according to ISO 8855 cite:[iso8855]. For
a non-rotated coordinate system, the following applies:

* Forward matches x-axis
* Left matches y-axis
* Up matches z-axis

The positive rotation is assumed to be counter-clockwise ("right-hand rule").
Orientation of objects is expressed extrinsically by the yaw, pitch, and roll
angles derived from the Euler rotation sequence in the order z-axis, then
y-axis, then x-axis.

.Coordinate system with defined rotations

<<fig-coo-sys-rotation>> shows the positive axes and positive directions of the
corresponding angles.

[#fig-coo-sys-example]
.Examples of rotations in coordinate system

<<fig-coo-sys-example>> shows the different states of a coordinate
system with defined rotations. x’/y’/(z’=z) denotes the coordinate system after
rotating x/y/z with the heading angle around the z-axis. The coordinate system
x’’/(y’’=y’)/z’’ denotes the coordinate system after rotating x’/y’/z’ with the
pitch angle around the y’-axis. The final rotated coordinate system
(x’’’=x’’)/y’’’/z’’’ is obtained after rotating system x’’/y’’/z’’ with roll
angle.

Each _3D model_ has an individual reference frame. Individual nodes of an
object may have local coordinate frames, for example, each wheel of a vehicle.


=== World coordinate system

A coordinate system of type (x, y, z) that is fixed in the inertial reference frame of
the simulation environment has the x~w~- and y~w~-axes parallel to the ground
plane and the z~w~-axis pointing upward.

Neither origin nor orientation of the world coordinate system are defined by the {THIS_STANDARD} standard. Nevertheless, the origin of the world coordinate system in an {THIS_STANDARD} environment should coincide with the origin of a corresponding ASAM OpenDRIVE map (if available).
The origin of the world coordinate system in ASAM OSI should also be aligned with these two coordinate systems.

=== Local coordinate system

Top-most local coordinate frames of _3D assets_ (so-called reference coordinate frames) in {THIS_STANDARD} are defined in the center of the bounding box of the corresponding asset, projected to the bottom of the bounding box.
By static transformations, these coordinate frames may be synchronized with reference coordinate frames in ASAM OpenSCENARIO XML and ASAM OSI.
<<tab-local-coordinates>> provides an overview of the translations between {THIS_STANDARD} asset reference coordinates and ASAM OpenSCENARIO XML and ASAM OSI reference coordinates.

[#tab-local-coordinates]
.Transformation of asset coordinates to ASAM OpenSCENARIO XML and ASAM OSI
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Standard |Coordinate System | Transformation

|ASAM OpenSCNEARIO XML | Vehicle | The origin is the center of the rear axle projected to the ground. Add the x-coordinate of the xref:../07_geometry/asset-schema.adoc#_rearaxle[rear axle] from the vehicle asset metadata to the {THIS_STANDARD} reference frame.
|ASAM OSI |Moving or stationary object | The origin is in the center of the bounding box. Add half of the height of the asset defined as the maximum z-coordinate in the xref:../07_geometry/asset-schema.adoc#_boundingbox[bounding box] to the {THIS_STANDARD} reference frame.
|ASAM OSI |Host vehicle | The origin is the center of the rear axle. Add the x- and z-coordinate of the xref:../07_geometry/asset-schema.adoc#_rearaxle[rear axle] from the vehicle asset metadata to the {THIS_STANDARD} reference frame.
|===


Besides reference coordinate frames, _3D assets_ may incorporate other local coordinate frames, see xref:../07_geometry/object-classes-introduction.adoc[Object classes].

== Naming conventions

=== General

The following naming conventions apply to {THIS_STANDARD} geometry files:

* The _3D model_ file and the related _3D asset_ file shall have the same base name.
  Example: `Example.gltf`, `Example.xoma`
* The naming convention inside the _3D model_ file (contains 3D information) must follow the capital Snake_Case definition, to improve human readability and enable consistent parsing of the file structure.
* The naming convention inside the _3D asset_ file (contains metadata) must follow the lowerCamelCase definition, to allow a consistent naming convention in all JSON files and consistent parsing.
* Keywords are predefined names for objects inside the node structure.

=== Node structure

Every node structure for a 3D object uses predefined keywords to allow a consistent naming convention and parsing.
Some keywords are already defined by the {THIS_STANDARD} standard and more could follow in future updates.
Users are free to add more keywords for themself, if they are needed. The following rules apply:

* All components shall be named according to capital snake case definition, starting with uppercase letters.
* Group nodes (also known as empty nodes or parent nodes) shall have "Grp_" as a prefix.
* Iterators shall be added as suffixes.
  In the documentation, iterator names are written in angled brackets. Example: `<type_idx>`.
  In the node name itself, the iterator names are replaced by integer values, starting from 0.
* Sequence of suffixes: 
** 1: Iterator 
** 2: Type Enumerator 
** 3: Subtype Enumerator.
* The predefined keywords shall be used for the corresponding asset parts and can be found in the corresponding subchapters.

=== Metadata

The following rules for metadata apply:

* Fields shall be named according to the lowerCamelCase definition, starting with lowercase letters.
* Naming of custom properties shall follow the predefined keys.
* Objects, arrays (lists), and enums shall follow the notation in the corresponding JSON files.

== _3D asset_ file

The _3D asset_ file provides metadata as well as a mapping table to {THIS_STANDARD} _material property_ files.
This information extends the geometry of an asset given in standard _3D model_ file formats, for example, glTF, FBX, or USD.
The _3D asset_ file is in JSON format with the file extension .xoma.
The asset file has to have the same file name as the accompanying _3D model_.
The following is an example of a _3D model_ file in glTF format with an accompanying _3D asset_ file:

* `my-model.gltf`
* `my-model.xoma`

== Requirements

* The geometry of the object shall be in real-word scale, using meters as the unit for measurement distances.
* The object's origins and pivot points shall coincide with position and orientation of the origin of the object's reference coordinate frame, unless otherwise specified.
* Meshes shall not contain problematic characteristics such as doubled, isolated, coincident, coplanar, degenerate, or primitives.
* Meshes shall have outside facing normals. Soft or hard edges shall be set correctly.
* Meshes shall not be empty or contain multiple level of details (LoDs).
* Meshes shall be triangulated. Potential normal maps shall match that triangulation.
* Rendering materials shall support physically based rendering (PBR) workflows and there shall not be geometry without assigned material.
* Additional requirements apply when {THIS_STANDARD} assignment textures are used:
** UV channel 1 shall be used for assignment textures.
** UV Islands shall have margins in between, so that assignment texture interpolation errors are avoided.
** There shall not be any geometry without UV coverage.


== Recommendations

* UVs should not overlap and be within 0-1 UV space.
* Elongated primitives should be avoided as they fit badly in acceleration structures.
* Alpha-textured meshes should be optimized to minimize the amount of alpha testing.
* Meshes should not have holes or gaps.
* Meshes should have a clean edgeflow.
* Usage of N-Gons is not recommended.
* Faces should be one-sided.
* An object's shape should have the lowest possible number of polygons.
* Texel density should be homogeneous and as low as possible.
* UV stretching should be minimized.
* Naming of files, nodes, meshes, and materials should be meaningful.
* Usage of multiple PBR maps is encouraged, for example, albedo, roughness, metallic, normals.
* Smaller objects should have one _material_ per object, for example, baked traffic cone. Larger objects should contain multiple seamless repeatable materials, for example, brick building.
