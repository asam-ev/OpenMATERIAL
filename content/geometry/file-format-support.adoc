{THIS_STANDARD} does not define its own _3D model_ format.
However, the geometry specification defines coordinate systems, units, node hierarchies, and more, which can be applied across different _3D model_ formats.

{THIS_STANDARD} supports the _3D model_ file formats glTF, FBX, and USD with the following considerations:

glTF::
_3D models_ of {THIS_STANDARD} in glTF format shall comply with the official https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html[glTF specification].
The glTF specification has two delivery options: glTF + bin + textures, and the container format glb.
Both delivery options are supported in {THIS_STANDARD}.
+
The glTF coordinate system is right-handed, with +Y as the up axis, +Z as forward, and -X as right. The front of a glTF asset faces +Z. 
+
This setup differs from how coordinate systems are defined in {THIS_STANDARD}, see xref:geometry/general.adoc#_coordinate_systems[Coordinate systems].
While modeling, the {THIS_STANDARD} coordinate definitions shall be used.
During export to and import from glTF, a coordinate transformation shall be applied to conform with the glTF specification.
Common modeling tools like Blender handle this conversion automatically.

FBX::
Although FBX lacks a formal specification, _3D models_ of {THIS_STANDARD} in FBX format shall be compatible with the official https://help.autodesk.com/view/FBX/2020/ENU/?guid=FBX_Developer_Help_welcome_to_the_fbx_sdk_html[AUTODESK FBX SDK].

USD::
_3D models_ of {THIS_STANDARD} in USD format shall comply with the official https://openusd.org/release/index.html[USD specification].
+
The USD coordinate specification allows either +Y or +Z as the up axis, defined in the upAxis metadata.
To adhere to the {THIS_STANDARD} geometry specification, +Z shall be used as the up axis.
